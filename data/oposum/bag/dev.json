        "the case looks lovely , and seems well made . and the laptop fits perfect there . it 's compact , padded everywhere and with a lot of compartments . the handle is adjustable and the laptop comes out easily . it is very durable . and for the price it is a great value . it has good form , three months later and the strap ripped . and they never even responded . 'd had a defective zipper . you ca n't adjust the strap so it is simply bad design . they 're not very durable . as far as internal padding , it 's a bit weak for my taste .", 
        "i was happy with this bag early on.. seemingly well padded , lots of space and pockets , and an attractive design for a reasonable price . it is very durable . sooner or later the plastic connector or the strap is going to break from wear . as far as internal padding , it 's a bit weak for my taste ."
